    "The Apostle’s Creed, sometimes referred to as the Old Roman Symbol, is an early statement of Christian belief. It is still used by many denominations for liturgy and catechism, including Presbyterians, Methodists, Congregationalists, Roman Catholics, Lutherans, and Anglicans.",
    "The Apostle’s Creed is Trinitarian&mdash;there is a section on God the Father, a section on Jesus Christ the Son, and a section on the Holy Spirit. However, because of its early date, it does not address controversies that occurred later, such as the deity of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit.",
    "The earliest known occurrence of the term \"Apostle’s Creed\" is in a letter from 390 AD from a synod in Milan."
